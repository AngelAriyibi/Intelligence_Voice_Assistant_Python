# Intelligence_Voice_Assistant_Python
In this project, I developed an intelligent voice assistant using a combination of speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies. The assistant can recognize spoken commands and perform various tasks such as creating notes, managing to-do lists, and responding to basic interactions.

The program performs the following tasks:
1. Reads and loads intents from a JSON file at the start of the program.
2. Uses speech recognition to capture and interpret spoken commands from the user.
3. Uses text-to-speech to provide audio feedback to the user.
4. Allows users to create notes by dictating them, which are then saved as text files.
5. Manages a to-do list where users can add items via voice commands.
6. Displays the current to-do list when requested by the user.
7. Responds to greetings and user can exit the program.
